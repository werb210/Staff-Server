Boreal Financial – Staff Server

This document is the single source of truth governing server behavior.
No feature, endpoint, UI, or integration may contradict this contract.

⸻

1. Purpose

This contract defines immutable system rules governing:
	•	Applications
	•	Lenders
	•	Lender Products
	•	Required Documents
	•	OCR & Banking Analysis
	•	Credit Summary
	•	Sales Pipeline
	•	Commissions & Profit Share
	•	Client / Staff / Lender boundaries
	•	Internal-only data

This contract ensures:
	•	Predictable behavior
	•	Auditability
	•	No retroactive rule changes
	•	Safe extensibility

⸻

2. Core Entities

2.1 Application
	•	Represents a single funding request
	•	One client may have multiple applications
	•	Applications are immutable after lender acceptance except for lifecycle state

⸻

2.2 Lender
	•	Represents a funding institution
	•	A lender may operate in multiple countries
	•	Country availability is NOT inferred from lender HQ
	•	Lender availability is derived only from product definitions

⸻

2.3 Lender Product
	•	Atomic funding offering
	•	Defines:
	•	Funding type (LOC, term loan, factoring, startup, etc.)
	•	Country availability
	•	Required documents
	•	Commission structure
	•	Profit-share rules (if applicable)

Startup Products
	•	Startup is not a global mode
	•	Startup appears only if a lender product is explicitly marked as startup
	•	No startup flows exist without a startup-enabled product

⸻

3. Documents & Analysis

3.1 Documents
	•	Raw uploaded files
	•	Versioned
	•	Immutable once accepted by lender
	•	May be reprocessed but never deleted

⸻

3.2 Financials (OCR Output)
	•	OCR results from non-bank documents, including:
	•	Financial statements
	•	Tax documents
	•	AR/AP
	•	Stored independently of banking data
	•	Never mixed with banking analysis

⸻

3.3 Banking Analysis (OCR Output)
	•	OCR results from bank statements only
	•	Typically 3–6 months
	•	Produces:
	•	Cash flow metrics
	•	Balances
	•	NSF / overdraft indicators
	•	Trend signals
	•	Banking OCR never lives in Financials

⸻

3.4 Credit Summary (Derived Artifact)
	•	Derived, not raw
	•	Aggregates:
	•	Financials OCR outputs
	•	Banking Analysis outputs
	•	Internal scoring logic
	•	Read-only
	•	Staff-only by default
	•	Used for:
	•	Rapid underwriting review
	•	Lender Matching scoring

No direct uploads.
No client or lender visibility unless explicitly enabled in future.

4. Sales Pipeline (Application Card)

4.1 Canonical Tab Order

The application detail view must appear in this exact order:
	1.	Application
	2.	Financials
	3.	Banking Analysis
	4.	Credit Summary
	5.	Documents
	6.	Notes (internal only)
	7.	Lender Matching

No reordering is permitted without updating this contract.

⸻

4.2 Notes
	•	Internal staff ↔ staff only
	•	Never exposed to:
	•	Clients
	•	Lenders
	•	Not included in exports, APIs, or external reports

⸻

4.3 Lender Matching
	•	Uses:
	•	Credit Summary
	•	Product country availability
	•	Required document completeness
	•	Never uses lender HQ location
	•	Matching is frozen once lender accepts

⸻

5. Commissions & Profit Share

5.1 Commission Types

A. One-Time Commission
	•	Paid on close
	•	Fixed percentage of funded amount
	•	Recorded at lender acceptance
	•	Immutable after acceptance

B. Profit Share (Revenue Share)
	•	Percentage of top-line revenue
	•	Calculated over time (e.g., daily / monthly)
	•	Continues for product-defined duration
	•	Frozen at lender acceptance

Example:
Client uses X for Y days → lender charges Z → Boreal receives N% of Z

Commission percentage is independent of deal size.

⸻

6. Country Availability (Critical Fix)
	•	Country availability is defined ONLY at the lender product level
	•	Lender HQ location is irrelevant
	•	Applications are matched solely based on:
	•	Product country list
	•	Client country

⸻

7. Required Documents
	•	Required documents are defined per lender product
	•	Products may add new required document types at any time
	•	Existing applications are unaffected unless explicitly re-requested
	•	System supports:
	•	Adding new document categories
	•	New OCR pipelines
	•	New validation rules
	•	No schema rewrite required for expansion

⸻

9. Mutability Rules
	•	Application data freezes at lender acceptance

	•	New OCR pipelines
	•	New credit signals
	•	New reporting dimensions
	•	New commission models

⸻

11. Enforcement

	•	UI, API, tests, and future Codex blocks must comply
	•	Changes require an explicit contract revision
